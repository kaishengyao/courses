## Logics and Entailment

1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08535.pdf

The idea of PossibleWorldNet incorporates sampled words and use them to evaluate an entailment. The score is then used as feature or directly used for prediction entailment. Adding possible words is a strong *grounding" process, as that can encode human knowledge into it. 

## Overview paper for conversational agent 

1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08419.pdf

This is a summary of the up-to-date work on conversational agent. I especially like the discussion of incorporating knowledge into conversational agent, aka. grounding. One method is using a ngram from query to link common sense knoweledge, from which a neural network model generates responses informatively.
